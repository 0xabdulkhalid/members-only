## How to Use

1. [**Head to the live site**](http://membersonly-app.glitch.me/) on any device using your browser.
2. Notice how you can view messages, but you can't see who wrote them or write your own. Let's fix that:
   - Click **Sign up** and create an account if you have not created one yet.
   - If you already have account then Click **Log in** and enter in your login information
   - Click **Message** to view messages and to write your own message, Hit `CTRL` + `ENTER` to send it.
3. You'll need to become a member to see who wrote messages and when.
   - Click **Become a Member**
   - Enter the secret passcode "`LetMeIn`" to become a member.
   - Congrats, now you're a member of the clubhouse! Go back to the homepage and see who wrote each message and when.
4. If you want to help moderate this site, you'll have to become an admin
   - Click **Become an Admin** (you have to be a member first in order to see this link)
   - Enter the secret passcode "`MakeMeAdmin`" to gain your admin privileges.
   - Congrats, now you're an admin! Go back to the homepage and delete messages as you see fit.

## Project Objectives

This project was built in order to practice implementing the following skills:

- To Manage sessions using [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) middleware, and to utilize [connect-mongo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo) to store sessions in MongoDB. which helps to retrieve and to persist sessions even after application's restart.
- Implement user authentication using the [PassportJS](https://www.passportjs.org/) middleware in our Express App.
- Secure passwords (hashing and salting) with [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) package.
- Use a MongoDB database to store users, messages, and session data.
- Implement the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) software design pattern
  - Build models to define what data structures my app should contain
  - Set up routes for requesting different information and templates (i.e. views) to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser
  - Build controllers for updating models and/or views in response to input from users of my app
- Build views and work with forms in Express using the PUG templating engine
- Add some client-side JavaScript to improve App's interactivity like Confirmation dialogs before deleting messages.
- Deploying the Application to production with proper security measures like hiding keys with Environment Variables (`env`).
